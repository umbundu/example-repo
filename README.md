# this is an example repository
1. we created the repo in git
2. we took the url:
    https://github.com/umbundu/example-repo.git
3. we ran git clone and used a local name wwith underscore to avoid problems with dashes:
    git clone https://github.com/umbundu/example-repo.git example_repo
4. now we create file README.md
5. we do:
    git add README.md
6. then we can do:
    git commit -m "first commit"

NOTICE THAT SO FAR THIS IS ALL LOCAL

7. now let's push this to our remote repo
    git push origin master
